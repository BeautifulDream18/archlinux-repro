repro(8)
========

Name
----
repro - reproducible builds utility


Synopsis
--------
'repro' <command> [options]


Description
-----------
'repro' is a script to help with verifying and checking reproducibility of
packages. It builds a linkman:systemd-nspawn[1] container with the Arch Linux
bootstrap image to build packages in a clean chroot. It has two modes of
operation, 'build' and 'check'.

'build' assumed a linkman:PKGBUILD[5] in the current directory and attempts to
build this twice and compares the resulting checksums. The builds will provide
different environments where we mix up timezones, locale and filesystem order to
properly find flaws with the package.

'check' takes a package as an argument and attempts to recreate the package with
the information provided with linkman:BUILDINFO[5]. It will use the Arch Linux
archive to fetch packages with the correct pkgver.


Commands
--------
**build**::
        Builds a package twice and compares sha512 checksums to check for
        reproducability issues. This assumes the current directory contains a
        PKGBUILD. See linkman:PKGBUILD[5] (This is the default command)   

**check** <package>::
        TBA
    

Options
-------
*-C*::
        Specify a linkman:repro.conf[5] file to use for the build container.

*-P*::
        Specify a linkman:pacman.conf[5] file to use for the build container.

*-M*::
        Specify a linkman:makepkg.conf[5] file to use for the build container.


Configuration
-------------
See linkman:repro.conf[5] for more details on configuring repro using the
'repro.conf' file.
